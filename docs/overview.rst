How It Works
============

- The device uses a small computer chip connected to your local WiFi network.
- It regularly fetches the latest solar X-ray flux measurements from a NOAA GOES satellite
- The device interprets the data and uses a simple LED to display:
  - **No activity** → dim or steady light
  - **Low-level activity** → slow blink
  - **High activity** → fast blinking
- Configuration is done via a built-in WiFi setup portal, making it easy to connect the device to any home network.

This makes the Solar Flare Alert a practical, hands-free monitoring tool for astronomy educators,
radio operators, scientists, or anyone interested in real-time space weather awareness.
