How It Works
============

- The device uses a small computer chip connected to your local WiFi network.
- It regularly fetches the latest solar X-ray flux measurements from a NOAA GOES satellite
- The device interprets the data and uses a simple LED to display:
  - **No activity** → dim or steady light
  - **Low-level activity** → slow blink
  - **High activity** → fast blinking
- Configuration is done via a built-in WiFi setup portal, making it easy to connect the device to any home network.

This makes the Solar Flare Alert a practical, hands-free monitoring tool for astronomy educators,
radio operators, scientists, or anyone interested in real-time space weather awareness.

OK. And now, you might be interested in learning more about solar flares?
:doc:`Here it goes then <introduction>`.

And, finally, if you fell courageous, you can also program the ESP32 microprocessor, which is
the core of this project.
:doc:`More instructions are given here <mp_install_esp32>`.

If you are going to make extensions or new version of the software,
you can also contribute using our GitHup page.

Have fun!
