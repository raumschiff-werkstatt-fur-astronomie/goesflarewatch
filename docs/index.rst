Welcome to the Solar Flare Alert Documentation!
================================================

The **Solar Flare Alert** is a compact, WiFi-enabled device designed to notify users in
real-time of significant solar flare activity. Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation
from the sun that can disrupt satellite operations, GPS systems, radio communications, and even power grids on Earth.

This alert system monitors solar X-ray flux data provided by a spacecraft and
translates that data into an LED brightness. The LED changes brightness or flashes
depending on the current intensity of solar flare activity — providing an immediate, ambient indication
without the need to check apps or websites.

There are several versions of the Solar Flare Alert: the white version is the standard
one; it can be assembled out of the box. The extended white version is the same, 
but needs to be built from scratch and is used usually in dedicatedworkshops. 
The green version is a bit more complex, it needs components to be soldered on the breadboard.

Check which one you have an jump to the corresponding assembling instruction.
