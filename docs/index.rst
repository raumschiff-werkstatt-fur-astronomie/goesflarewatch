Solar Flare Alert Lamp User Guide
=================================

The **Solar Flare Alert Lamp** is a compact, WiFi-enabled device designed to notify users in
real-time of solar flare activity. Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation
from the sun that can disrupt satellite operations, GPS systems, radio communications, 
and even power grids on Earth.

This alert lamp monitors solar X-ray flux data provided by a spacecraft and
translates that data into a brightness level of the lamp. 
The lamp changes brightness or flashes
depending on the current intensity of solar flare activity — providing an immediate, ambient indication
without the need to check apps or websites.

There are several versions of the Solar Flare Alert Lamp: the white version is the standard one; 
it can be assembled out of the box. The extended white version is the same, 
but needs a bit more assembly skills and willingness to tinker. 
It is usually put into practice in dedicated workshops. 
The green version is a bit more complex, it needs components to be soldered on the breadboard.

Check which one you have an jump to the corresponding assembling instruction.
