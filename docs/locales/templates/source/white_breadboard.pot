msgid "#. Take the tennis ball and make a small hole in it, large enough to mount the LED holder. #. Connect a wire to each end of the LED. #. Insert the LED holder into the hole in the tennis ball. #. Assemble the wire holder with one wire of the LED attached to each end. Ensure that the longer \"leg\" of the LED is connected to the ground wire. #. Mount the wire holder on the breadboard. #. Locate pin number 27 on the ESP32 development board. #. Plug the ESP32 development board into the breadboard. #. Connect a wire from the ground pin of the ESP32 board to the ground line on the breadboard. #. Insert the resistor into a free space on the breadboard. #. Connect a wire from pin 27 of the ESP32 board to one end of the resistor. #. Connect another wire from the other end of the resistor to one side of the wire holder. #. Connect a wire from the ground line on the breadboard to the other side of the wire holder. #. Plug in the ESP32 development board and test the setup using Thonny. For usage instructions, refer to the `Usage`__ section or continue reading."
