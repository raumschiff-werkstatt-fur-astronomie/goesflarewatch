"Solar Flare Alert is a set of applications designed to monitor the Sun's "
"activity using various hardware backends, including the **ESP32 "
"microprocessor**, which controls diverse LEDs. This system fetches real-"
"time data from the **GOES spacecraft** and processes it to dynamically "
"adjust the LEDs, either through brightness or color changes, visually "
"representing solar activity."

"The system uses the **GOES spacecraft** data to fetch the solar activity "
"levels, and it controls the LED(s) based on this data. The two main "
"front-end versions currently implemented are:"

"**Single LED Version**: A single LED gradually brightens with increasing "
"solar activity. It blinks when a flare larger than the M-class occurs, "
"and the blinking speeds up for X-class flares."

"**LED Strip Version**: An LED strip that varies in color according to the"
" intensity of solar activity."

"The project uses **Micropython**, specifically running on the **ESP32**, "
"which is very efficient as it requires no external processing (e.g., "
"Jupyter notebooks). You can install **Micropython** directly onto the "
"ESP32, download the necessary files, and get started right away. Check "
"out `<esp32.html>`_."

"While there is a **Python version** of the code for Arduino (which is now"
" deprecated), it involves using a Jupyter notebook to fetch the data from"
" the GOES spacecraft, process it, and send it to an Arduino via the "
"serial port. The Arduino then controls the LEDs based on the received "
"values."
