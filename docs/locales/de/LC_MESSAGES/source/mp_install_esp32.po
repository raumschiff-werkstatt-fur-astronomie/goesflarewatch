"The port where the ESP is attached may vary depending on the computer you"
" are using. For instance, on an M1 I get /dev/cu.usbserial-0001. How to "

"it automatically. On Mac, it might require an additional driver. If you "
"dont see the device, this might be due to a wrong cable. -- my personal "
"experience. Try another cable. One way is to open thonny and read the "
"port on the lower right of the window."
