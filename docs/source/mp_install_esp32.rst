How to use the solar flare alert on micropython
===============================================

Flashing MicroPython to ESP32
-----------------------------

The ESP32 development board is available at
various places, such as `Bastelgarage <https://www.bastelgarage.ch/nodemcu-32s-esp32-wifi-bluetooth-entwicklungs-board?search=wroom>`_, where you can easily find one near you.

* Install ``esptool`` either using ``pip install esptool`` or trough your package manager on Linux
* Download the recent firmware from http://micropython.org/download#esp32
* From the folder were you downloaded the firmware run ``esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash`` to erase the flash
* Run ``esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 <DOWNLOADED_FIRMWARE>.bin`` to flash it. But read remark below.
* Open a serial terminal (screen, putty, picocom) to check if you get a python shell.

On Mac:
---------

Mac doesnt know ``pip``, so you should use ``brew`` instead.

The port where the ESP is attached may vary depending on the computer
you are using. For instance, on an M1 I get /dev/cu.usbserial-0001. How to find out?
You can do this by starting Thonny and hopefully it will find it automatically.
On Mac, it might require an additional driver.
If you dont see the device, this might be due to a wrong cable. -- my personal experience. Try another cable.
One way is to open thonny and read the port on the lower right of the window.

Installing Thonny
-----------------

Thonny is a simple IDE for Python,
MicroPython and CircuitPython (Adafruits MicroPython fork),
it allows to upload your programs to a MicroPython board easily,
also when it doesn't show up as a USB drive.

To install it, the go to https://thonny.org/

Thonny tutorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-thonny-micropython-python-ide-esp32-esp8266/

Upload code
===========

Open `solar_flare_alert.py`, `libs/micropython-wifi_manager/wifi_manager.py`, and `rainbow2.py` in Thonny.
In `solar_flare_alert.py`, check if the options are correct, especially if the \
LED pins are correct,
the pin names on ESPs are a bit weird from time to time.

In the file boot.py, which should already be on the board, change the line
`import main` to `import solar_flare_alert` if it is there, or else
just add the line `import solar_flare_alert`

Save all files in the esp32 directory. You do not need to make subfolders, you can save everything in the main folder.


Wiring
======
On our board the pins are labeled with **IOxx** so it is
pretty straight forward.
The pins deliver 3.3V and some sources say max 12mA, we use a 110 Ohm resistor.

Testing
=======
In `solar_flare_alert.py` set RUN to False,
the program loop wont run and you can test the functions.
For example if the LED lights up correctly.
